Coffee                $5.50
Sandwich             $8.00

Then take a screenshot and save as an image.

## What OCR Will Extract:

The OCR system will automatically detect and extract:

âœ… **Merchant Name**: "Starbucks Coffee"
âœ… **Total Amount**: "14.58"
âœ… **Currency**: "USD" (auto-detected from $ symbol)
âœ… **Date**: "10/04/2025"
âœ… **Category**: "Food" (auto-detected from keywords)

## Tips for Best Results:

1. **Good lighting** - Make sure receipt is well-lit
2. **Clear text** - Receipt should not be crumpled or faded
3. **Straight angle** - Take photo from directly above
4. **High contrast** - Dark text on light background works best
5. **Supported formats**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP

## Example Test Flow:

```
1. Click "New Expense" â†’ Dialog opens
2. Click "Attach Receipt" â†’ Select image file
3. OCR starts automatically â†’ Shows "Scanning receipt..." with progress bar
4. After 3-5 seconds â†’ Green success card appears with:
   - âœ… Merchant: Starbucks Coffee
   - âœ… Amount: USD 14.58
   - âœ… Date: 10/04/2025
   - âœ… Category: Food
5. Form fields are pre-filled â†’ Review and edit if needed
6. Click "Submit" â†’ Expense created!
```

## Troubleshooting:

**If OCR doesn't work:**
- Make sure the file is an image (not PDF for OCR)
- Check browser console for errors
- Try a clearer receipt image
- Ensure text is readable and not too small

**If extraction is incorrect:**
- The form is editable - just correct the fields manually
- OCR confidence varies based on image quality
- The system shows what it extracted so you can verify

## Testing Different Receipt Types:

1. **Restaurant Receipt** â†’ Should auto-detect "Food" category
2. **Uber/Taxi Receipt** â†’ Should auto-detect "Travel" category
3. **Office Depot Receipt** â†’ Should auto-detect "Office Supplies"
4. **Software Purchase** â†’ Should auto-detect "Software" category
5. **Hotel Bill** â†’ Should auto-detect "Travel" category
